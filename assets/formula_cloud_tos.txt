FORMULA CLOUD Terms of service

These Terms of Services govern your access and use of the service "Formula Cloud"
under a subscription operated by Soundspear.
In the following terms, a "formula" means any piece of code published to Formula Cloud
and a "user" means an end-user of the Formula Cloud service.

1. Ownership
- You remain the sole owner of any code uploaded on Formula Cloud.
Soundspear will never claim any right for code made available on Formula Cloud to other users.
- If you wish to remove a formula that you published on Formula Cloud, please send an email to
contact@soundspear.com by specifying your Formula Cloud username and the name of
the formula you want to be removed.

2. Licensing
- If not specified, all code uploaded on Formula Cloud will be implicitly under the open source
MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), with you being the copyright holder.
- You can specify another license of your choice in a comment at the very top of a formula, or a reference
to the original text of the license.
- If an uploaded formula has not been created by his publisher, the original license of its source code will implicitly apply on
Formula Cloud. If that original license did not allow sharing the code on the Formula Cloud service, you might send
an email to contact@soundspear.com and request the removal of the formula by providing the necessary proof.

3. Security
- Soundspear put in place heavy security checks, both client-side and server-side, to prevent undesirable code from reaching the users.
- Despite those security checks, undesirable or malfunctioning code might be found in formulas. 
If you find such formulas, it is your responsibility to send an email to contact@soundspear.com to report it.
- Soundspear can not be held responsible for any damage or loss resulting from the use of the service.

4. Liability
- You may not upload viruses or malicious code that could impair the proper working of Formula Cloud
  or the integrity of its users.
- You may not share, resell or make available in any way your Formula Cloud subscription or your associated account.
- If those Terms of Service are not respected, Soundspear reserves the right to remove you
  definitively from the service without notice and refund.
